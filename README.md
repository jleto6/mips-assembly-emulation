# MySPIM ‚Äì MIPS Assembly Simulator 

A simplified MIPS processor simulator built in C for CDA3103C: Computer Organization.  
This project emulates the datapath, control signals, and instruction-level behavior of a basic MIPS processor using a modular C implementation.

## üß† Project Overview

**MySPIM** simulates key components of the MIPS architecture, focusing on:
- Instruction fetch and decode
- ALU operations and control logic
- Memory reads/writes
- Register file reads/writes
- Program counter updates
- Sign extension and branching

The simulator demonstrates the core principles of how a MIPS datapath executes instructions, simulating instruction behavior cycle-by-cycle on a Unix-based system.
